//: ## Welcome to the GroupsGenerator.
/*: In order to use it, you need two things
 1. A number of members you need in each group;
 2. an array that you want to divide into groups. It can have people, objects, actually anything that is `Equatable`.
 
 e.g. Ask your persons to choose a number between `1` and the maximum number of people you have.
 Once you have that, pass the values to the `generateGroups(of:with:)` and it'll give you the generated groups of random members and it'll show warnings if needed.
