### Welcome!
Hello and welcome to the repo. My name is ***Islombek*** and I'm truly excited to be a part of the RW iOS Bootcamp! I've always stood out by being passionate and going whole-heartedly in what I did and what I learned. 
In my early student years, I started learning iOS development using online materials and courses, unflatteringly *RayWenderlich* being some of the best ones! I asked my school to get me a subsription to it, but no-one did :disappointed: However, here I am! :blush: A blessed student of some of the world's best developers!

#### Programming experience
I started my journey waaaaaay long ago. I believe programming does not just start with code. It starts with ***passion***! It all just started with me being a kid who wanted to play video games on his computer. But the computer's system was out-of-order, so he had to learn how to reinstall Windows. It was a journey full of trial and error, but exactly these challenges led this little boy to the distances he wouldn't otherwise travel. 

One evening, I knew I was done for when I first put my hands on a second-hand 1st-gen iPod touch my uncle presented me when i was like 12. It was just a wow-effect device! THAT evening, I forgot its password! A few months later broke its system and had to jailbreak it again. Once I knew what iOS was, i heard about MacOS X. Then, I started asking questions like *"How can I install MacOs on my PC?"* And there started the trip of an illegal hackintosher. But, oh my, do i not regret any bit of my journey!  

This led me to dream about becoming an Apple engineer. And in early 2016 I got even closer to my dream. My beloved grandpa, May He Rest In Peace, gifted me a brand-new MacBook Pro 2015 with a brand-new iPhone 6S. I learned to make apps from different resources, RayWenderlich being one of a few of the best ones. I remember I asked my university rector to get me a yearly subsription to RW in condition that I would develop apps for the university. In vain! What a disappointment!
Anyways! in fall 2017 I joined a team at **[Datasite Technologies](http://datasite.uz)** as an intern and a very very junior developer. I could work my way up and build trust among my peers and the management so that they had confidence to assign me to other projects.

I left the company as a bird leaves its nest once its wings are strong enough. And in December 2017 I joined a team at [tickit.co](https://facebook.com/tickitco/) where I and a team of 4 set out to build the first ever online ticket-selling app in Uzbekistan - ***Tickit***.
My passion for building clear and outstanding user experiences helped me carve a niche for the app on Apple's App Store and land on No.7 spot in Uzbekistan's Entertainment section.
Early in 2018, my coursemates and I started a company to build America's best Transportation Management System using latest web and mobile technologies. Ever since I was developing on Google's Angular, but it was really pity that I had to put a hold on iOS development because i was the only one with programming XP. Almost three years later, here I am! In front of my good old friend, SwiftyPie :hatching_chick: 


Along the way, I and my team got #1 in Estonia's Garage48 hackathon (2018), developed an online store for North California Scooters company (but they made me make it look awful :dizzy_face:) (Summer 2017).

Except that I was a fierce Model-United-Nations-er. Mostly because I loved to meet new people , hear their stories, relate to them and make friends with them. After all, we are all people. We can't live without each other. :blush:
