## Struct or Class?
So which one?

In structs, I *always* had to give initializers, which would become pretty nagging after some time. In classes, however, I used *default* values in order to initialize my `BullsEyeGame` object with no properties. However, if I wanted to have some special places where I would want to initialize my game differently, i could just use the properties anytime.  

However, in this tutorial i believe it wouldnt matter *a lot*, which one of these we used, since there was little-to-none to do with value-based or reference-based abstracts. 

### That's why!
Honestly saying, i didnt feel like bothering about mutation that Structs would cause me, so I went with the good old Classes :)
